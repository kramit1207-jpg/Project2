        "executive_summary": "Momshad Khan is a high-achievement oriented engineering leader characterized by the 'Sharpshooter' archetype (High Calculativeness + High Dominance). With 20+ years spanning technical roles to Director of Engineering, he combines rigorous analytical thinking with decisive action. Currently focused on AI innovation, generative AI, and search evolution, he demonstrates strong extraversion (7.03) and conscientiousness (6.49) while maintaining a pragmatic, results-driven communication style that favors directness over rapport-building.",

He demands precision and data but won't tolerate slow decision-making. This archetype thrives on complex challenges requiring both deep analysis and bold action, but can be perceived as demanding or impatient with ambiguity.",

Moderate-to-high openness (6.47) indicates receptivity to innovation (evident in his AI focus), while somewhat agreeable (5.91) suggests he can collaborate but won't compromise on standards. Emotional stability (6.05) points to resilience under pressure typical of senior technical leaders.",
